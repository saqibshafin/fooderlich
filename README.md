In this project, I designed the UI of an app, which the food enthusiasts will use. Here, they can see what their other friends are cooking today, a list of recipes s/he wishes to cook, and a grocery list screen, where s/he will add or remove items that he needs to buys to make his favorite recipes.

This app is part of the book "Flutter Apprentice", by raywenderlich.com.
